Ford GoBike is the Bay Area's bike share system. Bay Area Bike Share was introduced in 2013. It services San Francisco, the East Bay and San Jose.  Similar to other bike share systems, Ford GoBike consists of a fleet of bikes that can be unlocked in one station and returned in any other network station. Thus, this is ideal for one-way trips. These bikes are available for use thorughout the year and riders have access to all bikes in the network.
